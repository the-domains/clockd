# Why Are We Here?

The status quo for employers is slow, expensive, and just plain awful (Spending hundreds of dollars posting to job boards, wasting hours setting a time to meet, and sitting though weeks of interviewing) resulting in the same results: In compatible schedules, poor culture fit, and high turnover. Meanwhile the best fit for the job is too busy applying through 100 other applications, filling in the same information, and getting no results while a hole burns in their pocket.

We're here because the hiring process sucks. On average it takes 60 days for an applicant to be contacted and set up a first round interview. That's 60 days in which you either need the money or need somebody to cover a shift, either way that's way too long. Because of this the relationship people have with finding and doing work, especially hourly work is very unhealthy. Clock'd is here with the audacity to ask the simple question "Why can't getting a job be easier?"

So what are we going to do about it? The short version: Create a digital ecosystem that fundamentally changes the way small businesses and talent go about working with one another. So sign up for our beta and ask yourself: Are you done wasting your time?
